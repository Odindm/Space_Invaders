## Description 

Space Invaders clone, built for the Athens School of Economic and Business' Department of Informatics course on C++ Development!

This project is a reimagining of the classic arcade game, with a few twists to keep things interesting.
Players must defend against waves of incoming aliens, using their laser cannon to blast them out of the sky.
As the game progresses, the aliens will become faster and more numerous, making for a challenging and exciting experience.

To build this project, we used C++ and the SGG library for graphics and input. 
The project is designed to be run on a desktop computer, and has only been tested on Windows.
